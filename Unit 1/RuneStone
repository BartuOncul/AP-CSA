## String Literal

String literal is enclosed in double quotes
A string literal in Java is an exact sequence of charaters (letters, numbers and symbols) which are enclosed in two quotation marks.

**For example)** "ABC123#Â£" or "1234567"

## Syntax/Complier Eror

These  erors occur when the code is wrongly typed. (Yazmada hata olursa Syntax/Complier Eror olur.)


## Logic Eror

Example) The programmer accidently uses a minus(-) instead of plus (+) when finding the sum of the numbers.

* A type is set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on them.
* Data type can be categorized as either primitive or referance. (non primitive)
* The primitive data types used in this course define the set of opertaions for numbers and boolean values.

## Exception

The program attempts to divide a number by 0.

## Primitive Data

boolean ---> True or False

int ----> 2,8,10,20

double ----> 2.5, 8.12, 11.7

Primitive data types are generally part of the Java. Except for String, non-primitive types are generally created by the programmer.
Non-primitive types can use mathods to perform actions, but primitive types can not.
