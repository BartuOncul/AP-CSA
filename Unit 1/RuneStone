## Syntax/Complier Eror

These  erors occur when the code is wrongly typed. (Yazmada hata olursa Syntax/Complier Eror olur.)


## Logic Eror

Example) The programmer accidently uses a minus(-) instead of plus (+) when finding the sum of the numbers.

* A type is set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on them.
* Data type can be categorized as either primitive or referance. (non primitive)
* The primitive data types used in this course define the set of opertaions for numbers and boolean values.

## Exception

The program attempts to divide a number by 0.
