While Loops
----------
The code inside the loop runs as long as the condition is true.
Infinite Loop Risk: Be mindful to change variables within the loop to avoid endless loops.
Use Case: Useful when the number of repetitions is not known beforehand (e.g., reading input until valid data is entered).


 For Loops
----------

A loop with three parts:
Initialization: Set the loop control variable.
Condition: Runs as long as the condition is true.
Update: Adjusts the control variable after each iteration.
Use Case: Ideal when the number of iterations is known (e.g., iterating over arrays).



Nested Loops
----------

for (int i = 0; i < outerLimit; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < innerLimit; j++) {
        // Code to execute in the inner loop
    }
}
